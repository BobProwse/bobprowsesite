Programmes are laid out week by week, day by day and exercise by exercise. There is an itroductory program to check your readiness for Level 1, it will help in deciding if you need individual advice. They are available as the Everfit app on your phone or other device using the store links at the top of the page.\n\n\nFollow a pre defined programme that follows on from your induction training or a programme that improves a specific component of fitness.\nAs no assessment has been made of specific goals the initial Pathway programmes aim to train all areas. One way of doing this is to target the bio-motor abilities as shown in the diagram. The overlaps between each identifiable ability (Speed, Strength, Stamina, Suppleness, Skill) lead to variations that can each be targeted by a training Means (Free weights, body weight, dumbbells etc).\nThere is a limit to the amount of time before a training programme becomes familiar and the training gains plateau. This is often refered to in the books (on the theory shelf in the office) as a maximum macro-cycle being about 55 days. The Pathway programmes change the exercise / loading in a shorter timescale to avoid this problem. They are available in Levels that progress in exercise specificity and training load.\nFind the Pathways programmes here:\nLevel 1 Unit 1 for 3 days a week\nLevel 1 Unit 1 for 6 days a week"

To make sure that everything you use during a session is replaced, you may need to consume more protein to check that stores are topped up for the repairing phase. Joints need extra help to look after the serious athletes knees or the beginner with an injury, your macro and micro nutrients need to be replenished to keep the endless list of tiny changes occuring correctly and of course sometimes we all need that extra boost of energy or nudge of help with our metabolism!\nOur most popular brands are Phd, Reflex, Powerbar, USN and Boditronics.
