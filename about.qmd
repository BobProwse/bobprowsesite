## History

After working in the Middle East Bob settled in Maidstone and opened a gym when doing such a thing was a bold new idea.

This was in the day when after a training session you retired to the bar to have a pint and smoke!

Bob was well known in the industry but his brother [Dave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Prowse) having been the Green Cross Code man and Darth Vader was from the Dark Side.

Bob ran the gym from 1982 until 2003 when he retired. Paul Slythe, a GB International 400m runner and Ian Sage who had a background in martial arts and body building, took over the company.

## Staff

Every client is taken through an initial stage of their training programme individually by one of our experienced and enthusiastic instructors. At regular intervals each member will have a private consultation with one of our fully qualified instructors, who will devise an appropriate first training programme.

If you have any queries about training, then please feel free telephone or contact us on the social media streams above.

About me...
I had the opportunity to gain work experience with Paul and Ian while studying Sports Science at University back in 2010. Now, a few years later, I have worked my way up to a Senior Gym Instructor position and become a successful Personal Trainer.

I have extensive experience helping people from all areas of fitness, whether it's for aesthetics, strength & conditioning, or general fitness. My approach focuses not only on training clients hard but also on ensuring they train smart. Although I can cater to clients with different fitness goals, my specialisation lies in strength and hypertrophy training, thanks to my background as a competitive rugby player and powerlifter.

After spending years in powerlifting and enjoying coaching, I successfully created the Bob Prowse Powerlifting Team, which competes frequently.
In addition to Personal Training, I offer bespoke online coaching for various goals, including powerlifting, aesthetics, and strength & conditioning.

Working together, I believe I can help you achieve fast results while enjoying the process. Feel free to contact me personally and check out my Instagram @simonmercercoaching.

Competitive bodybuilder


In my years of working in the fitness industry I have found my passion in helping women gain confidence in the gym, moving away from the quick fixes and pyramid schemes to help you fall in love with the process and realise its long term sustainability where in turn the effort will not seem a chore.
You might think the gym is not for you but I can guarantee you have yet to find what gives you that buzz and along the way I can help you achieve that goal, whether it be that defined and toned look you are after or to purely focus on building your physical and mental strength.

My focus is weight training as I love how you can transform your body with hard work and consistency. I am personally a competitive bodybuilder at British level in the bikini category and along with 6 years PT experience I have worked with a range of women who want to feel and look strong whilst making it practical and sustainable for all levels of experience.

I am able to tailor programmes with specific goals that are adaptable for your lifestyle. As a mum I understand how to create that balance and make your goals attainable to create that physique you desire.

Watching my clients progress is why I love what I do. Building a strong rapour is key to success and I want you to feel comfortable with me and have full faith that I have your goals at the front!

I offer individual personal training sessions/block bookings, and online coaching to keep you motivated and accountable throughout your fitness journey.

You will find me in the gym Monday through to Saturday, both with clients or putting myself through it. To arrange a chat about your fitness journey why not pop in and we can get a plan of action in place.

Charley Ashton 

Level 2 Gym Instructor 
Level 3 Personal Trainer 
Bootcamp Owner & Instructor 
Spin Instructor 

I spent many years as a competitive swimmer so I understand the dedication, discipline and commitment it takes to earn results. 

I have been working as a personal trainer for over 8 years and trained all abilities & ages with their specific goals.

I am owner of 2 local bootcamps with hundreds of members, running military style sessions for groups of over 70 people. I’ve helped support & coach those with little to no experience within fitness to become fitter, stronger, faster & more confident versions of themselves. 

For the last 6 years I’ve run a fitness retreat in Sotogrande in Spain where training covers anything from boxing, swimming, cycling & yoga in the sunshine. 

I love to train a functional fitness style, from focusing in on form & technique in weight lifting but most love doing tough, challenging, hardcore workouts leaving you feeling that post session buzz & sweat! 

As a mum and business owner I understand how life is hectic, busy and demanding but truly believe that an hour of you time can be so beneficial to both your physical & mental health. 

My business ethos has always been healthy body & healthy mind. 

Happy to meet for a free consultation to discuss your goals
