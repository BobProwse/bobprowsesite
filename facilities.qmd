My name is Katie and I've worked here at the Old Oak Gentlemen's Barbershop since January 2023. I qualified as a barber in 2017 after completing my training in Maidstone. I previously worked in the same shop from age 15 as the Saturday helper and this is where my love for barbering started. I knew I wanted to be a stylist one day. I get to meet so many new people day to day, as well as being able to create a trusting relationship with all my clients to ensure they always walk out looking and feeling their best! I am confident with all hairstyles from skin fades to scissor cuts and from toddlers to Seniors. I can take on a few new clients so don't hesitate to check out my instagram (@katiesfades) and DM with any questions you may have.

## Gym

A notable feature of Bob Prowse Health Club is the availability of additional facilities, which both complement and enhance the already high quality of service offered at this club.

These facilities include a fully equiped Main Gym, an Aerobic room, "War Room", Massage and Physiotherapy rooms, Sauna and a Lounge with a Supplements bar. We work with a number of partners to provide these services. See the Practitioners page to view the current details.
