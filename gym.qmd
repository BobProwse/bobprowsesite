## Gym

A notable feature of Bob Prowse Health Club is the availability of additional facilities, which both complement and enhance the already high quality of service offered at this club.

These facilities include a fully equiped Main Gym, an Aerobic room, "War Room", Massage and Physiotherapy rooms, Sauna and a Lounge with a Supplements bar. We work with a number of partners to provide these services. See the Practitioners page to view the current details.

See the gallery of photos below for an overview of our equipment and facilities.
